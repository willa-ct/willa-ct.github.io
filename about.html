    <p>
        I'm a recent graduate from Barnard College with a degree in English, Creative Writing. I'm also an actor, visual artist. Sometimes I dabble in costume design and music. I write fiction and non-fiction and wrote my senior thesis on transnational adoption in the context of globalization, language, and identity. I'm looking for a job that integrates my interdisciplinary skills to further social justice causes and diversify Asian American representation in arts and culture.
