        i'm a recent graduate from Barnard College, with a degree in English, Creative Writing. i'm also an actor, visual artist, and sometimes dabble in costume design. i write fiction and non-fiction and wrote my senior thesis on transnational adoption in the context of globalization, language, and identity. i'm looking for a job that integrates my interdisciplinary skills to further social justice causes and add representation to the Asian American adopted community.
