        I'm a recent graduate from Barnard College with a degree in English, Creative Writing. I wrote my senior thesis on transnational adoption in the context of globalization, language, and identity. I'm an NYC-based writer, actor, and visual artist. Sometimes I do costume design and make music. I'm looking for a job that integrates my interdisciplinary skills to further social justice causes and diversify Asian American representation in arts and culture.
