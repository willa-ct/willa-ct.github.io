            There was once a girl named Minna. She was born not too far from where her parents grew up. She was born under the sign of Aquarius, at a hospital surrounded by palm trees native to that island, and located two rivers away from her house, which everyone said was a sign of luck, to be born near water. The row of palm trees near her birth hospital had since been cleared away for apartment building complexes, which her parents had thought about inhabiting about seven years after she was born. As much as Minna tried to integrate with the flow of society and concrete life, usually she had her head elsewhere. So at dinner she usually wouldn't listen to the conversations around her, she was preoccupied with floating thoughts in her own head, usually which had to do with nothing lucid or coherent at all. Minna was good at one thing for sure, and that was dreaming. She kept her dreams, day dreams and night dreams, in immaculate order. She kept them in mason jars and labeled them with whatever pen or pencil was lying around. So her room was always crowded with her dreams, some of them deep indigo, others pastel, others pitch black. She cherished each one of her dreams, deeming each an essential part of her growing collection. She dreamed all day and all night. Some of the dreams were sharp, some triangular, some fuzzy and undefined, but she truly treasured their uniqueness. Her collection was one of her great sources of joy and serenity. But one day, when she was seventeen years of age, she dwindled with her dream collection. It was a gradual process, beginning at thirteen, but at seventeen she woke up one day with a feeling. The feeling was hard to define. She couldn't define her feeling as pleasant or unpleasant, she just knew that she didn't want to live in her dream world anymore. She couldn't dream up friends, or love, or fulfillment. She just knew that she was pretty lonely. At school, she looked around herself and wondered if she could ever catch up with her peers who had taken up residence in the real world for so long, that they had nothing in common with her or she with them. The lack of relatibility made her day to day existence rather drab and isolating.

            Locked away in a rather tall condo lived a girl named Lenny. She lived a very simple existence in her small apartment. She had a bathroom, a kitchen, a bed, and a couch. She had a small window that overlooked the city in which she lived. From her view, she saw the tops of the trees peaking out from the park far away and the distant buildings of another city. When she looked down, she saw cars and people walking about. "I wish I could join them," she often thought, locked away in her tower, but then she would let the thought pass. She couldn't leave her building for an unspecified reason. Not that anyone was forcing her to stay up there. She just couldn't find it within herself to venture outside the confines of her orderly, neat, and calm life. In her heart, she preferred watching the life outside bustle about rather than participating in it. But she truly didn't mind her simple existence. Every day, she woke up. She made herself a cup of coffee, sat on the couch, and painted mangoes. The painting of mangoes, in particular, made her feel rather good about her day to day life. Lenny knew that her skill in painting mango didn't amount to much to the face of the vast world. She could only paint mangos; nothing else. She couldn't draw people, or other inanimate objects that weren't mango. She drew them every single day, at multilpe angles, at her small circular wooden table in the kitchen. She knew for some reason that she had to keep repeating this skill of hers to keep it intact. Otherwise, it would fade away, and she would have nothing. One day, when Lenny was perfecting a shade of orange, someone rang her doorbell. She stood up, pushed in her chair, and opened the door. Before her was a girl about her height, with dark brown hair. This girl had a very pleasant and yet somewhat detached demeanor. "Hello," the girl said. "My name is Lulu." Lenny, who wasn't used to guests, but knew nevertheless of the etiquette required to interact with them, nodded her head and stood in the doorway. "Hello," Lenny said. "What can I help you with?" Lulu peeked over Lenny's shoulder, as though examining the confines of her living space. "Do you live here?" she asked. Lenny nodded. "Yes. This is my house. Would you like to come inside?" Lulu stood outside, neither moving nor exactly staying still, either. She tapped her foot on the ground. Lenny studied her, trying to figure out what was going on inside her head. Lulu didn't seem particularly threatening, more that she wasn't sure what to do with herself. "I guess," Lulu said. "I'm feeling a little disoriented. I just recently left my home, but I can't seem to find my way back. I'm confused as to what to do." Lenny nodded to express understanding and sympathy, though inside, had difficulty relating to this feeling of disorientation. She always knew where she was going; her apartment was small. She had no problem ever figuring out where to go. "Well, if you'd like, you can stay with me," Lenny offered. She invited Lulu in for tea. Lulu was flustered and a little embarrassed herself to be imposing herself.

        Today was a very pleasant day to be alive, thought Poppy. Poppy lived alone in an apartment that was perfectly square. Today was the kind of day where it was cloudy in the morning and afternoon, but perfectly clear at night. The sky was a gentle color. There was a purple cloud in the middle of the sky, laying perfectly flat and long on its side. Poppy looked out the window to her left. There were tall, tall buildings, many of them glass. They were much taller than her building. But they looked nice, reflecting the clear setting sky, many of the windows lighted inside like friendly rows of baby teeth or stars. Ah, she thought. What a good day to be alive. The sun was setting and she was going to put on slippers and boil a kettle of hot water. What a nice life.

        There was once a young individual named Nori. Her mother was a human, and her father was a fish. When Nori was young, she and her family lived in the countryside. They owned a pond. Her father, aunt, and uncle all lived in the pond, while her human mother spent her time on land working. Nori spent most of her time with her father and aunt and uncle, despite having the body of a human. She could speak to her fish relatives telepathically, a skill her mother did not have. Nori swam very well, and could hold her breath indefinitely. Although her mother had bought a house with a bedroom for Nori, Nori preferred to sleep in the pool. She found her mother's life boring and uneventful. But one day, her fish father died, and her mother met someone new. But this time instead of a fish, it was a human man. Nori was resentful of her mother, and spent most of her time talking to her fish aunt and uncle in the pond. Her mother accepted Nori's newfound distance as the new norm, but as things began to get more serious between her mother and her human boyfriend, he invited Nori and her mother to his house for dinner. Nori's mother told her to behave, as she was set on making a good impression on this new man who she wanted part of her life. Unbeknownst to him, however, Nori was half fish, so he served them grilled salmon without knowing the psychological damage this would do to Nori. Nori threw up at dinner and her mother had to take her home. Nori yelled at her mother, telling her how cruel it was of her to date someone who ate fish. Her mother sighed and was apologetic, but told Nori that she wanted a human life, because she was human, and had been living to accommodate her fish family her whole life. After many days of reflecting, Nori came to understand this. She started spending ehr time in the pool. She began helping around the house; sweeping, cooking, and most importantly, attempting to get used to the sensation of being detached from the pool, and walkng on land. And although Nori did her best to fit in with her mother's image of a normal, human life, she couldn't shake the conviction that hse would never be able to truly accept her mother's new human boyfriend into their life if he kept eating fish. Nori knew she had to do something. "Do we tell him?" she asked her fish aunt and uncle. "If you do, you know you won't be able to talk to us anymore," they said. "I know," said Nori, woefully. And she did know. She also knew she would no longer be able to breathe underwater, or swim as fast as she used to, but she knew nevertheless she had to tell the truth. It was the only way to live authentically in this new human life of hers and her mother's. When her mother's boyfriend came over next, he and Nori stood over the pond and chit-chatted. He eyed the fish - Nori's aunt and uncle - and remarked that he used to catch fish like that around his house when he was younger. The comment disturbed Nori. "James?" she said. "Yeah?" James said. "You know, if you're gona be part of our family, you can't catch or eat fish anymore." "Okay, can I ask why?" he said, looking rather vexed by her request without context. Just then, Nori's mother opened the door and announced that lunch was ready. Nori felt a lump in her throat. She knew she had to do it. "Mom, we have to tell him," she said. Mom tried to dissuade her, knowing the havoc it would wreak, but Nori held firm. They sat the boyfriend at the table in the kitchen and told him the truth; Nori is part fish. He laughed disbelievingly, but they showed him; how she could hold her breath for longer than what was humanly possible. He bit his lip, nervous, and drove away. He had thanked them for inviting him over and telling him, but that he really had to get going. As he drove away, Nori and her mother watched him go. It was then that they realized it was truly only themselves left. Nori could no longer talk to her fish relatives, and her mother no longer had her boyfriend. They were worlds away frmo where they each felt they belonged. Perhaps now they could form a new sense of home within each other.

        Orange believed that the root of all evil was subjectivity. She truly wished she could slip into other people's minds. She was daily discouraged also that people weaponized empathy to forgive evil, though in the Bible and many other kinds of religious or life coach teachings, one is supposed to forgive evil. She found herself in quite a conundrum.

        An old song came on the radio. It reminded her of a very pleasant time in her life. She was reminded in particular of a time she and her friend were in a grocery store together, picking out a can opener in a store in their hometown. It made her melancholy. It reminded her of the vast insignificance of this fact to anyone. She couldn't even share the feeling with her friend, Marnie, who she'd drifted apart from and who had moved away, because she herself was trapped in a vastly different subjective experience of being in the store listening to that song and picking out the can opener. Perhaps it meant nothing to her. It pained her to be trapped in this powerful and specific feeling and for it to truly amount to nothing in the grand scheme of things and time. It was reserved only for her memory where it lived vividly now, however distorted. She experienced its intensity all on her own.

        Orange felt that she was well-integrated into society. Though, there was no way for her to know for sure. It seemed like the kind of thing other people outside of herself would have authority to say. Interactions and ways of functioning in the world, all of her responses to external stimuli, felt as though it was filtered through a computerized lens too fast for her to realize and then exported into the world for others to see. If other people could see this inner working of her mind, they'd probably think she was quite odd.

        Oval was locked in a tower. A guy who really liked her, though he'd never really seen her up close before, stood outside her window and asked her to let down her hair, so that he could climb up and see her. Oval crossed her arms, annoyed. "My hair is short," she said, and inwardly was insulted that he didn't notice this very obvious feature about her. "And even if it wasn't, I don't think you're athletic enough to climb up it. Why don't you just take the elevator."

        My name is Howard Johnson. I'm American. I am part of the American people. I am a person who lives in America, along with a lot of other people. When you say the word 'American' over and over it starts to dissolve and sound like a jungle or an animal. Like most Americans, I live in an enclosure. I own a car. On the weekdays, I wake up and take my antidepressants and go to work. I have a white collar job, a professor. I have a salary, insurance, vacation days, a wife, and two kids. My wife is a therapist. We are raising up our kids to be good, upstanding citizens of society. On weekends, I wake up a little later than I usually do. I listen to the radio and drink a cup of cofee and watch the sun rise over the buildings. At night, sometimes I invite friends over. I made all of them from work. I listen to other American people on the radio say things like "the American people the American people the American people."

       There was once a girl who was born with a blue star on her head. The blue star had special properties. It gave her an ability to heal animals and sense unnamed feelings in whatever room she was in. But she hated these abilities, finding them useless. It wasn't that she didn't care for animals or other people's feelings, there were just more important things to her as a fifteen year old who wanted social acceptance and a fun, carefree, pleasurable existence in high school. She didn't think that was a crime. However, the blue star made this exceptionally hard, because nobody else had one, and she was embarrassed. The blue star stood out, and not in a cool way. It just looked weird. She tried wearing a hat or getting bangs so she could cover it, but someone always ended up saying, "hey, what's that on your forehead?" And what could she say, that she didn't know? Nobody would buy that she didn't know she had a blue star on her head. Then they would just think she was lying. She heard that if you acted like something wasn't a big deal, others didn't think it was a big deal, either. So she usually ended up saying to whoever asked her about it, "oh yeah, just this thing on my head," and try to downplay it. But downplaying in a way made it worse, because sometimes the other person crinkled up their nose and said, "wow, okay, not like it's a big deal or anything," and think she was a huge snob. When in reality, she wasn't a snob, she just didn't want people staring at the blue star on her head and thinking she was different for it. And usually people, if they didn't think she was being a snob about it, thought she was just weird for having it. She honestly couldn't decide which was worse: trying to cover it up, and having it be super obvious to the whole world that she not only had this anomaly on her forehead but also that she was trying to cover it, or not covering up, and simply walking around like she didn't have the good social common sense to see that what she had on her forehead was weird to have in the open like that. She went home and cried to her family and screamed "why did you give this to me!!! it's ugly!!!! i hate it!!!! take it off!!!!" Her mom or dad or sister sighed, and gave each other a look, like she was going through a rebellious teen phasee. Her family, none of which had stars on their head, shook their heads and said, "we didn't give it to you. Nobody did. You were born with that. Just calm down. Do you know how many people would kill to be able to have the powers you have?" "So they can have them," she said, furious. "just because I have this star doesn't mean I need to do something with it, it's not fair! i just want to live my life!!!!! I don't care about animals or feelings, i care about being loved and socially accepted! god damn it!" Her family exchanged glances again. She knew what this meant, this look always meant they were thinking: what a spoiled little girl we have in our family of good people.

        Gigi was a girl who lived in a house by herself. Gigi had a small life, and she liked it that way, because she could manage everything without much chaos or trouble. If one were to describe her life, one could imagine or compare it to keeping a room neat that only had two objects in it. Gigi usually woke up around 8 a.m, or, at most, 3 or 4 minutes before or after that. She brewed herself a cup of coffee. She lived rather frugally, but she invested in good coffee; the beans she bought were of high quality, and usually expensive. She felt obliged to tend to the few pleasures of her life. Her coffee, like her nightly phone conversations with her sister, or games of chess on the weekend with her best friend at the local board game cafe 4 blocks away from her house, or the scent of steaming pork broth on Friday afternoons when she had no work that day, was one of her simple yet most vibrant and reliable pleasures. Gigi preferred reading and studying over most anything else. She wouldn't categorize herself as lonely, per se, perhaps just studious and inclined more to introspection and simplicity than anything loud, rambunctious, or unpredictable. Because of this, she had a rather stable inner life. She rarely had explosive scenes or out of control emotions, because she was always reliably alone, and knew and had always known what that felt like at all times within herself. She knew what to expect of herself when it came to her emotional world. And because she was constantly prepared for and subsequently met with her own solitude, she rarely felt anything other than peace of mind.

        Tutu was not like other people. She wasn't born of parents. Rather, she was part of an elaborate experiment by the government who wanted to help population control in North America. So instead of being born, she manifested into being. She still lived her life like many other young girls. She went to school, and most people didn't know this different fact about her life. For some reason, she always kept quiet about it, because she hated being singled out. Admitting that she materialized out of stardust was a bit embarrassing. People started calling her slurs, like "dustface" and "void." Through all this social conditioning though and feelings of alienation, she grew up lonely, albeit with a rich emotional, spiritual, and creative inner life. Tutu recognized that her unique background gave her these strengths, and eventually came to embrace it. However, when she came of age, around her late teens, she realized that she was not, in fact, the first girl to be born of this government test. There were, in fact, a total of 350 other individuals in the entire world who were manifested of cosmic dust. She found this out when she had gotten an invitation in the mail. "Come to our first ever counsel meeting!" the letter voice said. "To be born of dust can be truly devastating to one's mental health. Let's have a support group for it!" The letter was signed by someone named Beebee. Tutu was suspicious. For some reason, she mistrusted the voice in the letter. She also couldn't shake the annoyance that someone had thought of this idea before her. She turned the letter over, and found an address and date. Tutu sighed. She supposed she could go. Besides, she was curious at the idea of others who came to be as she did. So she packed a bag, put on her best lipstick, and attended this conference. "Let's go around and introduce ourselves," the leader spoke. Tutu presumed her to be the one who sent the invitations. Tutu gritted her teeth, and wondered why she hated this girl so much. What arose in Tutu was a passionate aversion to being categorized and defined by this fact about her origins that she'd struggled for so hard and so long to come to terms with, and had finally succeeded. She'd freed herself of it, and these people were trying to pull her back. The girls went around the room crying and sharing their stories of emotional and mental damage, crippled by this horrible governmental test, but Tutu seriously didn't care to hear about it. Instead, Tutu was filled with indignation. "Pathetic!" she silently thought. When it came turn for Tutu to introduce herself, Tutu screamed with rage and ran out the door. "You people don't know me. I am nothing like you and I don't want to be associated with you!!! I'm strong! I felt the pain and I got over it, so why don't you! God damn it! We may share this fact about our lives, but you don't know me and will never know what it's like to be me!"

        It was nighttime and she was in the kitchen. Outside, the moon rose over the city buildings and skyscrapers. She paused her chopping of carrots, turned off the faucet, and looked outside. The moon floated above the skyline. It was in a gibbous shape and benevolent looking. It gave her comfort, to see the man-made modern city, with thousands of people inhabiting their tiny lighted square lives, pictured with the almost-full moon moon, ancient and eternal. It was like witnessing modernity and future and technology sealed into a lovely painting, never quite escaping the past. No matter what technological progress, it would always amount to nothing. The moon had alwyas been there, before her life, the life of her grandparents and great grandparents and ancestors, and would exist long after. It made her feel small and have feelings of goodwill towards humankind, which was unusual for her.

        Her heart was made of the same material as the moon. The moon seemed loveable only from a distance. It was at its most attractive and alluring at its farthest and most untouchable. Not attractive directly due to its distance, per se, but simply because if one flew to the moon and came as close as one could be to it, it would look maybe drab and unremarkable in appearance. It would be nothing but a dusty rock that one was standing on, just another dusty surface to stand on. Perhaps it was more alien than that, she didn't truly know. But she did feel the moon was meant purely for being looked at from far away, which made its existence sad.
