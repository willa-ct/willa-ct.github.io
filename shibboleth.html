        hello there! this is where my messy unpublished writing will go. i have a hard time writing when i feel like no one is going to see it, but having a web page will at least create the illusion of someone potentially seeing it, therefore propelling me to write.

            There was once a girl named Minna. She was born not too far away from where her parents grew up, under the sign of Aquarius, at a hospital surrounded by palm trees native to that island, and two rivers away from her house, which everyone said was a sign of luck, to be born near water. The row of palm trees near her birth hospital had since been cleared away for apartment building complexes, which her parents had thought about inhabiting about seven years after she was born. As much as Minna tried to integrate with the flow of society and concrete life, usually she had her head elsewhere. So at dinner she usually wouldn't listen to the conversations around her, she was preoccupied with floating thoughts in her own head, usually which had to do with nothing lucid or coherent at all. Minna was good at one thing for sure, and that was dreaming. She kept her dreams, day dreams and night dreams, in immaculate order. She kept them in mason jars and labeled them with whatever pen or pencil was lying around. So her room was always crowded with her dreams, some of them deep indigo, others pastel, others pitch black. She cherished each one of her dreams, deeming each an essential part of her growing collection. She dreamed all day and all night. Some of the dreams were sharp, some triangular, some fuzzy and undefined, but she truly treasured their uniqueness. Her collection was one of her great sources of joy and serenity. But one day, when she was seventeen years of age, she dwindled with her dream collection. It was a gradual process, beginning at thirteen, but at seventeen she woke up one day with a feeling. The feeling was hard to define. She couldn't define her feeling as pleasant or unpleasant, she just knew that she didn't want to live in her dream world anymore. She couldn't dream up friends, or love, or fulfillment. She just knew that she was pretty lonely. At school, she looked around herself and wondered if she could ever catch up with her peers who had taken up residence in the real world for so long, that they had nothing in common with her or she with them. The lack of relatibility made her day to day existence rather drab and isolating.
