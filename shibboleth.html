        hello there! this is where my messy unpublished writing will go. i have a hard time writing when i feel like no one is going to see it, but having a web page will at least create the illusion of someone potentially seeing it, therefore propelling me to write.

            There was once a girl named Minna. She was born not too far from where her parents grew up. She was born under the sign of Aquarius, at a hospital surrounded by palm trees native to that island, and located two rivers away from her house, which everyone said was a sign of luck, to be born near water. The row of palm trees near her birth hospital had since been cleared away for apartment building complexes, which her parents had thought about inhabiting about seven years after she was born. As much as Minna tried to integrate with the flow of society and concrete life, usually she had her head elsewhere. So at dinner she usually wouldn't listen to the conversations around her, she was preoccupied with floating thoughts in her own head, usually which had to do with nothing lucid or coherent at all. Minna was good at one thing for sure, and that was dreaming. She kept her dreams, day dreams and night dreams, in immaculate order. She kept them in mason jars and labeled them with whatever pen or pencil was lying around. So her room was always crowded with her dreams, some of them deep indigo, others pastel, others pitch black. She cherished each one of her dreams, deeming each an essential part of her growing collection. She dreamed all day and all night. Some of the dreams were sharp, some triangular, some fuzzy and undefined, but she truly treasured their uniqueness. Her collection was one of her great sources of joy and serenity. But one day, when she was seventeen years of age, she dwindled with her dream collection. It was a gradual process, beginning at thirteen, but at seventeen she woke up one day with a feeling. The feeling was hard to define. She couldn't define her feeling as pleasant or unpleasant, she just knew that she didn't want to live in her dream world anymore. She couldn't dream up friends, or love, or fulfillment. She just knew that she was pretty lonely. At school, she looked around herself and wondered if she could ever catch up with her peers who had taken up residence in the real world for so long, that they had nothing in common with her or she with them. The lack of relatibility made her day to day existence rather drab and isolating.

            Locked away in a rather tall condo lived a girl named Lenny. She lived a very simple existence in her small apartment. She had a bathroom, a kitchen, a bed, and a couch. She had a small window that overlooked the city in which she lived. From her view, she saw the tops of the trees peaking out from the park far away and the distant buildings of another city. When she looked down, she saw cars and people walking about. "I wish I could join them," she often thought, locked away in her tower, but then she would let the thought pass. She couldn't leave her building for an unspecified reason. Not that anyone was forcing her to stay up there. She just couldn't find it within herself to venture outside the confines of her orderly, neat, and calm life. In her heart, she preferred watching the life outside bustle about rather than participating in it. But she truly didn't mind her simple existence. Every day, she woke up. She made herself a cup of coffee, sat on the couch, and painted mangoes. The painting of mangoes, in particular, made her feel rather good about her day to day life. Lenny knew that her skill in painting mango didn't amount to much to the face of the vast world. She could only paint mangos; nothing else. She couldn't draw people, or other inanimate objects that weren't mango. She drew them every single day, at multilpe angles, at her small circular wooden table in the kitchen. She knew for some reason that she had to keep repeating this skill of hers to keep it intact. Otherwise, it would fade away, and she would have nothing. One day, when Lenny was perfecting a shade of orange, someone rang her doorbell. She stood up, pushed in her chair, and opened the door. Before her was a girl about her height, with dark brown hair. This girl had a very pleasant and yet somewhat detached demeanor. "Hello," the girl said. "My name is Lulu." Lenny, who wasn't used to guests, but knew nevertheless of the etiquette required to interact with them, nodded her head and stood in the doorway. "Hello," Lenny said. "What can I help you with?" Lulu peeked over Lenny's shoulder, as though examining the confines of her living space. "Do you live here?" she asked. Lenny nodded. "Yes. This is my house. Would you like to come inside?" Lulu stood outside, neither moving nor exactly staying still, either. She tapped her foot on the ground. Lenny studied her, trying to figure out what was going on inside her head. Lulu didn't seem particularly threatening, more that she wasn't sure what to do with herself. "I guess," Lulu said. "I'm feeling a little disoriented. I just recently left my home, but I can't seem to find my way back. I'm confused as to what to do." Lenny nodded to express understanding and sympathy, though inside, had difficulty relating to this feeling of disorientation. She always knew where she was going; her apartment was small. She had no problem ever figuring out where to go. "Well, if you'd like, you can stay with me," Lenny offered. She invited Lulu in for tea. Lulu was flustered and a little embarrassed herself to be imposing herself.

        Today was a very pleasant day to be alive, thought Poppy. Poppy lived alone in an apartment that was perfectly square. Today was the kind of day where it was cloudy in the morning and afternoon, but perfectly clear at night. The sky was a gentle color. There was a purple cloud in the middle of the sky, laying perfectly flat and long on its side. Poppy looked out the window to her left. There were tall, tall buildings, many of them glass. They were much taller than her building. But they looked nice, reflecting the clear setting sky, many of the windows lighted inside like friendly rows of baby teeth or stars. Ah, she thought. What a good day to be alive. The sun was setting and she was going to put on slippers and boil a kettle of hot water. What a nice life.
