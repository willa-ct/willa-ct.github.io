        hey there! thank you for taking the time to find this page. i don't know what i'll be putting here! perhaps various musings on the human consciousness being uploaded to the cloud, or the latest entries in my dream journal.

    <b>fun facts about me</b><br>
    i have synesthesia<br>
    i was born in Nanchang, Jiangxi, China but grew up in Manhattan, New York City. <br>
    i have two sisters: a younger sister and an older biological sister (i met her through 23andme!)<br>
    i'm really into personality tests and psychology. i'm a capricorn sun/gemini rising/gemini moon/capricorn venus/sagittarius mercury/aquarius mars, INFP, enneagram type 4, which definitely describes me to a T<br>
    i've moved homes twice before i turned 18   
    <br>conspiracy theories are really cool! i don't believe in flat earth but the videos are compelling<br>
    my favorite movies to date: <i>eat, drink, man, woman//tampopo//scent of green papaya//hana & alice</i> [the 2014 rotoscoped version]<br>
    i love watching behind-the-scenes of movies i like. i'm especially fascinated when costume designers explain how they express character development through colors/clothing.<br>
    lately, i'm into mood rings and layered chokers from the early 2000s<br>
    i'm currently trying to learn how to read tarot cards with the biddy tarot podcast, with varying degrees of success.
   <br>favorite food: any kind of shellfish, probably crab
    <br>i write stories about offbeat Asian girls who love disco music, outer space, and science. i like exploring themes of divorce, female friendship, sisterhood, and environmentalism. i'm a sucker for the occasional dream sequence and a good romantic subplot.
    <br>i had a phase in high school where i was really into video games. not mainstream games like cod//halo/gta etc (except skyrim) but small-scale indie video games.
