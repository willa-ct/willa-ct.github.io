    hello there! thank you for taking the time to find this page. i don't know what i'll be putting here! perhaps various musings on human consciousness being uploaded to the cloud, or the latest entries in my dream journal.

    <b>fun facts about me</b><br>
    i have synesthesia<br>
    i was born in Nanchang, China but grew up in New York City. <br>
    i have two sisters: a younger sister and an older biological sister (i met her through 23andme!)<br>
    i'm really into personality tests and psychology. INFP, enneagram 4, and my astrological chart definitely describe me to a T.<br>
    i've moved homes twice before i turned 18.
    <br>conspiracy theories are really cool! i don't believe in flat earth but the videos are compelling.<br>
    my favorite movies to date: <i>eat, drink, man, woman//tampopo//scent of green papaya//hana & alice</i> [the 2014 rotoscoped version].<br>
    i love watching behind-the-scenes of movies i like. i'm especially fascinated when costume designers explain how they express character development through colors and clothing.<br>
    lately, i'm into mood rings and layered chokers from the early 2000s.<br>
    i'm trying to learn how to read tarot cards with the biddy tarot podcast, with varying degrees of success.
   <br>favorite food: any kind of shellfish, probably crab.
    <br>i write stories about offbeat Asian girls who love disco music, outer space, and science. i like exploring themes of divorce, female friendship, sisterhood, and environmentalism. i'm a sucker for the occasional dream sequence and a good romantic subplot.
    <br>i had a phase in high school where i was really into video games. not cod/halo/gta etc (except skyrim, the sims, & civilization) but rather smaller scale indie video games (shelter, this war of mine).
    <br>my favorite show right now is PEN15.
    <br>what i'm reading: "feel free" by zadie smith.
    <b>oct 21 2020</b>
    <p>lately i've been thinking about the exponential growth of technology and the human race graduating to a world of screens, where lives are lived online. things are headed that way, and in a way, that's the way things are right now. soon we will be on technology so much that we won't even be engaging in reality anymore. everything will be online. i often wonder why it would have had to develop this way. i've started wondering if it has something to do with our origins as people. in the movie "like water for chocolate" tita is told that we all long to return to our divine origins. for me, what is meant by "divine origin" is a return to a spiritual space of light (in a physics sense) in which time is compressed or cyclical or not linear. and i think the internet, the digital world, does that. it compresses time and place. you can access a different part of the web in a single click, you don't have to travel there. on social media, someone documents their time in paris, uploads it to their story, and you can see it and interact with it in a single tap. perhaps this is why the internet is so addicting and why we are drawn into it, perhaps it simulates a strong inborn desire to escape our bodies. eventually the human race might short-circuit to that divine space and we'll all have graduated to light particles.
