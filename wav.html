    hello there! thank you for taking the time to find this page. i don't know what i'll be putting here! perhaps various musings on human consciousness being uploaded to the cloud, or the latest entries in my dream journal.

    <b>fun facts about me</b><br>
    i have synesthesia<br>
    i was born in Nanchang, China but grew up in New York City. <br>
    i have two sisters: a younger sister and an older biological sister (i met her through 23andme!)<br>
    i'm really into personality tests and psychology. INFP, enneagram 4, and my astrological chart definitely describe me to a T.<br>
    i've moved homes twice before i turned 18.
    <br>conspiracy theories are really cool! i don't believe in flat earth but the videos are compelling.<br>
    my favorite movies to date: <i>eat, drink, man, woman//tampopo//scent of green papaya//hana & alice</i> [the 2014 rotoscoped version].<br>
    i love watching behind-the-scenes of movies i like. i'm especially fascinated when costume designers explain how they express character development through colors and clothing.<br>
    lately, i'm into mood rings and layered chokers from the early 2000s.<br>
    i'm trying to learn how to read tarot cards with the biddy tarot podcast, with varying degrees of success.
   <br>favorite food: any kind of shellfish, probably crab.
    <br>i write stories about offbeat Asian girls who love disco music, outer space, and science. i like exploring themes of divorce, female friendship, sisterhood, and environmentalism. i'm a sucker for the occasional dream sequence and a good romantic subplot.
    <br>i had a phase in high school where i was really into video games. not cod/halo/gta etc (except skyrim, the sims, & civilization) but rather smaller scale indie video games (shelter, this war of mine).
    <br>my favorite show right now is PEN15.
    <br>what i'm reading: "feel free" by zadie smith.

    i've been thinking about the exponential growth of technology and how the human race is graduating to a world of screens. i feel like in the future, we won't be engaging with the physical 3-d world anymore. in the movie "like water for chocolate," tita is told that we all long to return to our divine origins. i personally think that what is meant by "divine origin" is both spiritual and scientific, a place where time is cyclical or nonlinear. the digital world seems to do that. clicks and taps replace physical travel and time is compressed. maybe this is why the internet is so addicting. it simulates a strong inborn desire to escape our bodies. eventually the human race will short-circuit to the divine singularity space in which we graduate to light particles.
